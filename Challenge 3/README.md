In this code, the zumo uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect object and the go and around an object after it has detected an object

First, the zumo goes forward searching for an object and rotates to the left and right to search for an object
If the distance of the object is less than 50cm from the zumo
It will go backward,
then rotate to the left 90 degrees,
then move forward,
then rotate to the right,
then move forward,
and this step is performed 4 times in order to achieve the zumo going around the object once it has detected it
After moving around the object, the zumo then briefly rotate left and right and goes forward to search for another object.
